# Design Systems: A DSL for Visual Identity

A design system, in its essence, is much more than a library of reusable components: it's a domain-specific language (DSL) for expressing a graphic identity.

Like any DSL, a design system defines:

- A constrained **vocabulary** (colors, typography, spacing, components)
- A **grammar** of composition (how these elements combine)
- **Semantic rules** (when and why to use a given element)

The business domain here is not order management or accounting, but the set of rules that make an interface visually belong to a brand. These rules, often tacit in designers' minds, find in the design system an explicit and executable codification.

## The Vocabulary: Design Tokens

The DSL's vocabulary manifests in design tokens: named variables that capture the fundamental decisions of the identity.

`color.primary.500`, `spacing.lg`, `font.heading.xl` are not mere values: they are terms of a shared lexicon between designers and developers.

Like value objects in DDD, they encapsulate business meaning: `color.error` is not just red, it's the red that means error in this system. Using `#FF0000` directly in code would be like using a raw string instead of an `EmailAddress` type: technically functional, but semantically impoverished and fragile in the face of changes.

## The Grammar: Composition Rules

The DSL's grammar emerges from composition rules:

- A primary button on a light background uses such combination of tokens; on a dark background, another
- Spacing between elements follows a harmonic scale, not arbitrary values
- Components nest according to established patterns: a `Card` contains a `CardHeader`, a `CardBody`, a `CardFooter`, in that order

These constraints are not limitations but [affordances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affordance): they guide toward coherent compositions while forbidding, or at least making difficult, combinations that would violate the graphic identity.

The system makes invalid visual states hard to represent, see our article on [Make Illegal States Unrepresentable](/en/advanced-software-engineering/type-design/make-illegal-states-unrepresentable).

## The Ubiquitous Language of Design

The analogy with business DSLs extends to the notion of *ubiquitous language*.

When designers and developers share the design system vocabulary, conversations become precise and unambiguous. "Use a secondary button with spacing-md" is an executable sentence, directly translatable to code, visually verifiable.

Design reviews and code reviews converge toward the same reference. Inconsistencies (a developer improvising a color, a designer proposing off-grid spacing) become immediately visible as violations of the common language.

The design system, like any good DSL, creates a communication space where ambiguity is reduced.

## Governance and Evolution

This perspective of considering a design system as a DSL has implications for system governance.

Evolving a design system is evolving a language: adding terms, deprecating others, modifying grammatical rules. These changes must be managed with the same rigor as a public API: versioning, migration, documentation of breaking changes.

- Tokens become contracts
- Components become stable abstractions whose implementation can change without affecting consumers

And as with any successful DSL, the value lies less in individual elements than in the systemic coherence they produce together; a coherence that, ultimately, constitutes the visual identity itself.
