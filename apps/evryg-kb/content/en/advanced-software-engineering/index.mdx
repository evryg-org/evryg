# Advanced Software Engineering

Advanced software engineering rests on solid theoretical foundations. This section explores concepts that enable building reliable, expressive, and maintainable systems.

## Topics

- **Type Systems**: type algebra, algebraic types, Curry-Howard correspondence
- **Modeling**: state machines, DDD, isomorphisms at boundaries
- **Design**: Parse Don't Validate, Make Illegal States Unrepresentable
