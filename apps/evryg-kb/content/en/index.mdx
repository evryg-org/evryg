## Our Approach

At evryg, we believe that technical excellence rests on solid theoretical foundations. This knowledge base gathers our thoughts on:

- **Type systems** and their ability to prevent errors before runtime
- **Lean software delivery** and value stream optimization
- **Software quality** as an architectural discipline
- **Mathematical abstractions** underlying modern programming

Each article aims to make advanced concepts accessible, with concrete examples and links to original sources.
